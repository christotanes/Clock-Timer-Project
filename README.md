# Clock with alarm and timer

### [Link to github page](https://christotanes.github.io/Clock-Timer-Project/)

This is a personal practice project I did on the side while I was learning in a Bootcamp. This was not a requirement and I just wanted to learn.

I learned how hours, minutes and seconds can be calculated in JavaScript and in the world of computer programming.

I also have JavaScript to change the background depending on the time of the day. I believe the single page app should be responsive.

I had issue with the audio loading in an iOS as an iOS would block the audio playing without user interaction but the app has user interaction when an alarm time was set which was problematic, but I understand why it was blocked.
